# Ethics manifesto 

I want to use data to help people. I want to people to know how I use their data with their permission. 

My goal in life is to be the best machine learning engineer that I can be. 

I want to be a person to spread awareness of how data is being used. 

I want to be a person that will be able to go home with a clean conscious.

I feel that data is a double edge sword, and it can hurt both the user and the people that is being used on. I pledge on this manifesto, that I will do my best to consider both sides so that I would be able to use the data to help and not to hurt.

Overall I wish to help people, make their lives better and work to bring awareness to big data.


## My Ethical Principles

My five rules of my ethics are:
1.	I want to use data to create value that will help people
2.	I want to not be creepy with the data I use 
3.	I donâ€™t want to use it so that government or entities can use data to control people.
4.	Data is sacred no matter how trivial it may seem 
5.	I will continually improve myself to understand and use data better

I feel that even though we learnt from our mistakes and now we have to set up institutional review board (IRB) for any research that has to do with humans, I think that there should be a country wide management IRB that hires official people that can then be hired by companies or school that needs an IRB. I feel that if everyone gets to choose who they want to hire. The company or school could just hire anyone with any moral compass.
